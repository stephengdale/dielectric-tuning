This repository contains full datasets and example scripts for the article entitled `Linear fractional charge behaviour in DFT through dielectric tuning of CPCM' by Luke O. Hemmingsen, Oliver A. J. Hervir and Stephen G. Dale.

Data and example scripts are separated into dielectric-tuning, a-tuning (global hybrid) and w-tuning (range-separated). Data is further subdivided into deviation from linearity (generated by Eq 2 from the article), VIE errors and optimized parameters (included in the vie data in the a/w-tuning cases).

optimized_using_square optimizes the same data-sets, this time minimizing $\int_0^1 F(q)^2dq$ using the golden ration method, rather than the Eq 3 and the bisection method used in the article. Note the averages between sets are very similar.
